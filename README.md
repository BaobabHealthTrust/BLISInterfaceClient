This is the Baobab Health Trust fork of the BLISInterfaceClient by ilabafrica.  We have modified this software in the following ways:
* a command-line only user interface (ui.Cli) so that it can run without a monitor - e.g., raspberry pi
* refactoring of the code to separate ui and business logic and employ OO architecture
* a new interfaces for the Mindray BC3000, Aquios CL, Erba XL200, Mindray BS120, Mindray BC 5800, Erba Lyte Plus
